Inspired by a YouTube video by 3Blue1Brown: https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k

A Python application that uses Fourier Series to draw the SVG path of a simple image outline. The user is able to start/stop the animation, clear the canvas, centre the camera on the origin, and reset the animation. The user is also able to change the number of circles (sine waves) used to approximate the SVG path, and centre the camera on the drawing tip or keep the camera stationary.
